# Report Back — Week 1 Email (Demo)

**Subject:** DA25 — Week 1 submission — Mohamed Saleh

Hello Dr. Graham,

Here are my Week 1 materials:

- GitHub repo: https://github.com/MookaSaleh/week1 (shawngraham invited)
- Hypothes.is profile: [https://hypothes.is/users/myusername](https://hypothes.is/users/MookaSaleh)
- Annotation permalinks: see `annotations-links.md` in repo

Notes:
- I had a minor GitHub error with remotes but fixed it.
- I’d like feedback on my interpretation of the “deformance” concept.

Thanks,  
Mohamed Saleh
