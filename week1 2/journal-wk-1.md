# journal-weekk-1 (Reflection)

**Week:** 1 (Sep 8–12, 2025)  
**Focus:** Getting my digital workspace set up

## 1) Sentence that resonated
> “Digital archaeology is not just about using digital tools but about how those tools shape our questions and knowledge-making.”  
— Morgan, C. (2022). *Current Digital Archaeology*. Annual Review of Anthropology.

I liked this because it reframes the work: I’m not just learning tools, I’m learning how tools change what archaeology *is*.

## 2) My starting idea of “digital archaeology”
I assumed it was just databases and 3D models. After this week, I see it’s also about collaboration, reproducibility, and openness.

## 3) WWW: Weird • Wonderful • Worrying
- **Weird:** The idea of “deformance” — breaking things to see new insights.  
- **Wonderful:** Seeing Hypothes.is turn reading into a social space.  
- **Worrying:** Whether GitHub will be too technical for me long-term.

## 4) Getting started
- Wins: created my first GitHub repo, joined the private Hypothes.is group.  
- Roadblocks: error with git remote (fixed).  

## 5) Notes from the podcast
- Key terms: open access, reproducibility, “safe to fail.”  
- The interview felt a bit dated; I wonder how AI is being discussed today.  
- Follow-up: searched “digital archaeology AI 2020–2025” in Google Scholar.

## 6) Where I want to go next
I want to learn how to use JupyterLite for both note-taking and small data experiments.
